# Sequential_modeling
This project is aim to try and create musical notes by training deep sequential model.
Here, Model uses mitdeeplearning library to get training data for this model.
Python install needed:

apt-get install abcmidi timidity > /dev/null 2>&1

pip install tensorflow mitdeeplearning tqdm


#outcome
After training this model, model will be able to generate a musical notes that sounds just like a professional music composer.
