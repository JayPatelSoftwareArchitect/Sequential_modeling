# Sequential_modeling
This project is aim to try and create musical notes by training deep sequential model.
Here, Model uses mitdeeplearning library to get training data for this model.
Python packages needed:
>tensorflow 
pip install tensorflow
>mitdeeplearning
pip install mitdeeplearning
>tqdm
pip install tqdm
apt-get install abcmidi timidity > /dev/null 2>&1

#outcome
After training this model, model will be able to generate a musical notes that sounds just like a professional music composer.
